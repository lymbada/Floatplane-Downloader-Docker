# Floatplane-Downloader
If your like me and at the mercy of whatever speed of internet happens to be currently avaliable, then this is a handly little docker container to assist in getting the media from your Floatplane subscriptions dowloaded so that you can enjoy them.

# Issues
Well this is only an initial build, currently the container runs, but you do need to manually configure the internal 'settings.json' file, because the commandline prompting doesn't work.
